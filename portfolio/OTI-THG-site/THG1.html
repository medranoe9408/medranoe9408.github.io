Summary: Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the tributes for District 12 
in the 74th annual Hunger Games. In the dystopian society of Panem, there 
is poverty, hunger, and oppression. The Hunger Games, are a way of 
entertaining the people who work in the capital.  The Tributes for the 
hunger games are drawn from big fishbowl type orbs, and there are two 
tributes per district. Through the movie, the games are nothing like 
Katniss and Peeta perpared for, and the publicty that came with being a
tribute was both unsettling and overwhelming for them. The pair face many 
enemies through the games alone, then during the climax of the movie they 
find a way back to eachother. The gamespeople tell them two tributes can win as long as they are from 
the same district. In the end they were the only two left, but the gamepeople
changed the rules and said they have to kill eachother and only one of them
could win. Peeta and Katniss refuse to kill eachother, and instead win together
by threatening to take poisonous berries at the same time knowing people are 
watching everywhere.
