The Hunger Games is a trilogy based off of the trilogy written my Suzanne 
Collins. The movies are based around the districts of Panem during the 74th-
76th Hunger Games. In this futuristic, dystopian society, the capital draws
two names from each district, one boy and one girl, to fight against in 
the Hunger Games. The 74th annual district 12 girl tribute is Katniss Everdeen. 
She is the protagonist and we follow her throughout the trilogy. Her male 
counterpart from district 12, Peeta Mellark, and Katniss are forced to test
themselves, mentally, physically, and emotionally, to make it through the games.
